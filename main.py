# We are going to write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.
# If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number,
#  the program displays “Lower number please”. Similarly,
#  if the user’s guess is too low,
#  the program prints “higher number please”. 
# When the user guesses the correct number, 
# the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.

# Hint: Use the random module.
